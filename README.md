# Stomach

Stomach is an attempt to understand source control softwares.

## What does it looks like?

Unlike many other source control tools, Stomach doesn't require initialization.
Each project is automatically initialized when at least one file is eaten and
digested:

```bash
$ stomach eat [files...]
$ stomach digest [message]
```

As you can see, Stomach has its own terminology that's chosen to be fun rather
than functional. Although it essentially differs from commonly-used softwares,
some similarities can be observed.
